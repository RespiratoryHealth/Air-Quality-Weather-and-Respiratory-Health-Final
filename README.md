Project Overview:

This dataset simulates a real-world scenario for public health and environmental monitoring. It integrates data on: • Air quality indicators • Weather conditions • Mobility patterns • Healthcare utilization (specifically, respiratory-related hospital and emergency visits) The data covers five regions over two years (2020–2022) and examines how environmental factors and mobility impact respiratory health.

Project Objectives & Scope:

We will explore: Temporal trends: How weather parameters change over time (daily, monthly, seasonally). Geographical comparisons: Differences in weather and air quality across continents or climate zones. Correlations: Relationships between variables like temperature vs. humidity, or air quality vs. precipitation. Extreme conditions: Identifying regions with extreme temperatures, poor air quality, or unusual weather events. Environmental insights: How air quality metrics relate to weather conditions and what that implies for public health or climate change.
